# Project Management Plan
## Introduction

In this project, we are creating an interactive website to assist students in Project Management in Business and Technology. This website helps students in learning all 5 Process Groups (i.e., initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing) and all 10 Knowledge Areas (i.e., Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Schedule Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Management, Project Procurement Management, Project Stakeholder Management. This website also includes a quiz for students on the various processes in each knowledge area.

The application consists of useful information about the 5x10 PMBOK matrix with 49 processes. The quiz helps students learn much about Project Management since it will allow each student to take unlimited attempts and also a detailed explanation of the answers.
We integrate the various knowledge area plans into the Project Management Plan. The following are the various knowledge area plans:

## Project Scope Management Plan

The scope management plan describes how the scope will be defined, monitored, developed, controlled and verified. 
### Defining scope - Requirements Specifications
| S.No    |   Requirement |   Priority    |   Type |
| ----    |   ----------- |   --------    |   ---- |
| 1.      |   The application should support user login.   |   High    |   Functional |
| 2.      |    There should be 10 place holders, one for each knowledge area.     | High  | Fuctional |
| 3.      |   The application should be able to maintain scores of the student and leaderborads.  |   High  |   Non-Functional |
| 4.      |   The data regarding the knowledge areas should be reliable and recoverable.    |   Medium  | Non-Functional |
| 5.    | The student data that is being maintained should be manageable and consistent.   | Medium    | Non-Functional |

### Scope Statement
The project scope statement is a description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions and constraints.
#### Product scope description:
The following features that are included in the scope of the application:
- The student should be able to login into the quiz using a user login.
- The application should consist of 10 place holders, one for each knowledge area.When clicked the placeholder, the information regarding the knowledge area should be dispalyed. When clicked again, the information should be hidden.
- Student scores and leaderboards should be maintained.The leaderboard should consist of a sorted list of students with high scores at the top.
#### Deliverable:
The application that provides information on the knowledge areas and process groups and also, tests the student in the form of a quiz on the PMBOK processes is delivered at the end of the project.
#### Project exclusion:
Any changes that the client specifies after signing the requirements specification document are out of scope of this project.
#### Constraints:
- Scope constraint: The application consists of quizes on only the 10 knowledge areas and the 5 process groups of project management.
- Time constraint: According to our schedule management plan, the development of the project should be completed by last week of June and the system and user acceptance testings should be completed by last week of July. Any necessary final changes should be made and the project should be closed and delivered to the client by last week of August.
- Cost constraint: The developement of the project should be completed within the defined budget of the project, which is 50,000$.
#### Assumptions:
- Project team has expertise in developing webapps and interactive applications.
- Project costs will stay the same as initially budgeted costs.
- Project scope will not change once the stakeholders sign off on the scope statement
- Funding for licenses to all the tools will be provided as needed.

## Project Cost Management Plan

- Level of accuracy:
We rounded the cost estimates to the nearest $100.
- Units of measure:
Cost estimation is done in US Dollars.
- Organizational Procedures links:
We use the WBS as a framework to provide the consistency with estimates.
1. Control thresholds:
    Control thresholds are having CPI or SPI less than 0.9 or greater than 1.2.
1. Rules of performance measurement:

    a.	Earned Value Management is used to measure the performance of the project.

    b.	We will calculate Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI to measure cost performance.

    c.	If the variance of SPI or CPI is within 0.2 and 0.4 the Project Manager reports the reason behind the problem.

    d.	 If the variance of SPI or CPI, is greater than 0.3, the Project Manager generates a report on the corrective actions to be taken to bring the project back to its normal state.

1. Reporting formats:
    A monthly project status report will be submitted about the cost manageable. All the corrective actions needed in the cost management plan are reported in this document.
1. Process Descriptions:
    Description of all the processes in cost management is documented.

## Project Quality Management Plan

We will perform quality management to ensure that our project satisfies the needs for which we are implementing it.
### Quality Metrics:
A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how the control quality process will measure it. Some of the quality metrics that we would lilke to include in our project are on-time performance, cost control,detect frequency of monitoring the project, reliability, functionality, test coverage etc.

Quality Management in our project involves carrying out the following processes:
- Performing Quality Management: During this process, we identify which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to satisfy them.
- Performing quality assurance: In this Process, we periodically evaluate the  overall project performance to ensure the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards.
- Performing quality control: In this process, we monitor specific results of the project to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards.

We achieve quality assurance in our project using various techniques like:
- Lean: where processes are evaluated to maximize customer value while minimizing waste
- Benchmarking: where ideas for quality improvements are generated by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the performing organization
- Quality Audit: in which a structured review of specific quality management activities that help identify lessons learned that could improve performance on current or future projects are provided.

We achieve quality control in our project using various tools like:
- Cause-and-Effect Diagrams: We use them to identify many possible causes for an effect or problem and sorts ideas into useful categories.
- Control Charts: These are graphs that can be used to study how a process changes over time. Comparing current data to historical control limits leads to conclusions about whether the process variation is in control or is out of control.
- Pareto Charts: These are histograms that can help us identify & prioritize problem areas in our project.

Using these metrics to measure the quality and other tools and techniques for quality assurance and control, we are going to achieve quality management in our project.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

We used the following risk mitigation strategies:

| Resource Risk | Technical Risk | Market Risk | Cost Risk | Schedule Risk |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| New substitute employees must be recruited in different areas for emergency requirements | Ensure proper knowledge transfer from current employees to the new employees | Make the customers in the market familiar with the product | Be ready to meet the costs of new licenses of softwares or systems if required | Increase the authority of Project Manager |
| Allocate cost for new employees | Increase frequency of project monitoring | Gain knowledge on the competition in the market | Use WBS and CPM | Select the most experienced person in the project as the project manager |
| Assign knowledge transfer sessions for new employees |  Review the deliverable and its quality before it is released into the market | Know how to innovate the product based on the current technologies in the market | Increase frequency of project monitoring | Use WBS and CPM |
| Give importance to team support and avoid stand-alone project sturcture | Use WBS and CPM | Release the product into the market in appropriate time | Allocate some extra cost for any unknown requirements | Increase frequency of project monitoring |
