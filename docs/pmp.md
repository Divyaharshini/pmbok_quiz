# Project Management Plan
## Introduction

In this project, we are creating an interactive website to assist students in Project Management in Business and Technology. This website helps students in learning all 5 Process Groups (i.e., initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing) and all 10 Knowledge Areas (i.e., Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Schedule Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Management, Project Procurement Management, Project Stakeholder Management. This website also includes a quiz for students on the various processes in each knowledge area.

The application consists of useful information about the 5x10 PMBOK matrix with 49 processes. The quiz helps students learn much about Project Management since it will allow each student to take unlimited attempts and also a detailed explanation of the answers.
We integrate the various knowledge area plans into the Project Management Plan. The following are the various knowledge area plans:

## Project Scope Management Plan

The scope management plan describes how the scope will be defined, monitored, developed, controlled and verified. 
### Defining scope - Requirements Specifications
| S.No    |   Requirement |   Priority    |   Type |
| ----    |   ----------- |   --------    |   ----|
| 1.      |   The application should support user login.   |   High    |   Functional |
| 2.       |    There should be 10 place holders, one for each knowledge area.     | High  | Fuctional |
| 3.      |   The application should be able to maintain scores of the student and leaderborads.  |   High    |   Non-Functional |
| 4.      |   The data regarding the knowledge areas should be reliable and recoverable.    |   Medium  | Non-Functional |
| 5. | The student data that is being maintained should be manageable and consistent.   | Medium    | Non-Functional |

### Scope Statement
The project scope statement is a description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions and constraints.
##### Product scope description:
The following features that are included in the scope of the application:
- The student should be able to login into the quiz using a user login.
- The application should consist of 10 place holders, one for each knowledge area.When clicked the placeholder, the information regarding the knowledge area should be dispalyed. When clicked again, the information should be hidden.
- Student scores and leaderboards should be maintained.The leaderboard should consist of a sorted list of students with high scores at the top.
##### Deliverable:
The application that provides information on the knowledge areas and process groups and also, tests the student in the form of a quiz on the PMBOK processes is delivered at the end of the project.
##### Project exclusion:
Any changes that the client specifies after signing the requirements specification document are out of scope of this project.
##### Constraints:
- Scope constraint: The application consists of quizes on only the 10 knowledge areas and the 5 process groups of project management.
- Time constraint: According to our schedule management plan, the development of the project should be completed by last week of June and the system and user acceptance testings should be completed by last week of July. Any necessary final changes should be made and the project should be closed and delivered to the client by last week of August.
- Cost constraint: The developement of the project should be completed within the defined budget of the project, which is 50,000$.
##### Assumptions:
- Project team has expertise in developing webapps and interactive applications.
- Project costs will stay the same as initially budgeted costs.
- Project scope will not change once the stakeholders sign off on the scope statement
- Funding for licenses to all the tools will be provided as needed.
