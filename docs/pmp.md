# Project Management Plan
## Introduction

In this project, we are creating an interactive website to assist students in Project Management in Business and Technology. This website helps students in learning all 5 Process Groups (i.e., initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing) and all 10 Knowledge Areas (i.e., Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Schedule Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Management, Project Procurement Management, Project Stakeholder Management. This website also includes a quiz for students on the various processes in each knowledge area.

The application consists of useful information about the 5x10 PMBOK matrix with 49 processes. The quiz helps students learn much about Project Management since it will allow each student to take unlimited attempts and also a detailed explanation of the answers.
We integrate the various knowledge area plans into the Project Management Plan. The following are the various knowledge area plans:
