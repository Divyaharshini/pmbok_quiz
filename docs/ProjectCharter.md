# Scope
## Phase 1 - Initiation
In this phase, we deliver:
- A project charter
- The supporting artifacts
- A contract and supporting documents
This phase includes development of:
- Initial stories by role
- Initial acceptance criteria
- Initial E-R diagrams
- Initial sample data
- Initial project sketches
- Initial scope, schedule, budget
## Phase 2 - Planning
In this phase, we deliver:
- Combined project charter
- Integrated supporting artifacts (we take the best from phase-1)
This phase includes development of:
- Final stories by role
- Final acceptance criteria
- Final E-R diagrams
- Final sample data
- Detailed project sketches
- Architectural decisions, including platforms, languages, frameworks, libraries, cloud resources, data stores, releases, milestones, authentication, authorization, etc.
- Schedules for sprints, client presentations, milestones and acceptance criteria
- Construction of product backlogs built from epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks
## Phase 3 - Implementation of architectural prototypes
In this phase, we deliver:
 - Updated versions of all artifacts
 - Working prototype deployed in each proposed platform
 - Presentation of architectural prototype to client and extended team (include pros & cons of these choices).
 - Together with the client decide what platform(s) will be selected for implementation.
 - Client acceptance of the plan
 ## Phase 4 - System requirement specification
 In this phase, we deliver:
 - Complete implementation plan.
 - Suggested project organization.

 # Schedule
 The following initial schedule that will be followed:
 - Phase 1 completed and presented at the end of week 1 as part of milestine-1.
 - Phase 2 completed and presented at the end of week 2 as part of milestine-1.
 - Phase 3 completed and presented at the end of week 3  as part of milestine-1.
 - Phase 4 finalized and published at the end of week 4  as part of milestine-1.
 - Project reflections and discussions completed by the end of the course.
 # Budget
 Since this is a graduate team project, we are doing it free of cost. So it is a zero-budget project.
 # Risk
 The major risk associated with this project that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule is that, the client changes requirements that come into picture in mid-project.
 # Accepatance Criteria
 - Given some knowledge area as a placeholder in the application, when clicked all the information regarding that knowledge area should appear.
 - Given some knowledge area as a placeholder in the application, when clicked again all the information regarding that knowledge area should be hidden.
 - Given a quiz, when finished the score should be evaluated and should appear on the scree.
